Treelight is a randomized composition made for the <a href="https://vimeo.com/120197076">Tree of Light Project</a>. It uses the music programming language <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">ChucK</a> to initialize multiple oscillator "voices" which then switch between a random melody and chords based on OSC messages recieved from a touch sensor.
